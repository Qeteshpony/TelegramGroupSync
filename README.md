### A simple bot that can sync members of two Telegram groups

If you have one group with member management and you want a subgroup for another topic without effort this is the 
right bot for you. Make it admin in both groups and hand out an approval link to the secondary group and the bot will
automatically approve all requests from people who are in the primary group while denying everyone else. 

If anyone leaves the primary group they get automatically kicked out of the secondary as well if they're in there.
